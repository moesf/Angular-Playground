# Form validation with Angular.js 

Validating a Form Model Client-Side:

1. Validate the form client-side using HTML 5 form attributes. 
2. Angular.js works in tandem with HTML 5 form attributes. Add some HTML 5 attributes to make the input required. Also add name="" attribute to the <form> to activate form directive.
