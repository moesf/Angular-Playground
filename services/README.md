# Using External Services

From Angular documention: 

Angular has built-in support for communication with remote HTTP servers. The $http service
handles low-level AJAX requests via the browser's XMLHttpRequest object or via JSON with
padding (JSONP). The $resource service lets you interact with RESTful data sources and
provides high-level behaviors, which naturally map to RESTful resources.
